# PrintPDFs

This is a simple java desktop application that will allow you do print only the first page of every PDF that you have in a specific folder in your computer

With a simple User Interface, just add the folder that includes the PDFs and click "Print!"

I really needed it for myself, and I hope that you find it useful as well.
